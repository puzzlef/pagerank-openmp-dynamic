Design of OpenMP-based Parallel Dynamic [PageRank algorithm] for measuring importance.

PageRank serves as an algorithm assessing the significance of nodes within a network through the assignment of numerical scores based on link structure. Its applications span web page ranking, identification of misinformation, traffic flow prediction, and protein target identification. The growing availability of extensive graph-based data has spurred interest in parallel algorithms for PageRank computation.

In real-world scenarios, graphs often evolve over time, with frequent edge insertions and deletions rendering recomputation of PageRank from scratch impractical, especially for small, rapid changes. Existing strategies optimize by iterating from the previous snapshot's ranks, reducing the required iterations for convergence. To further enhance efficiency, it becomes crucial to recalibrate the ranks of only those vertices likely to undergo changes. A common approach entails identifying reachable vertices from the updated graph regions and limiting processing to such vertices. However, if updates are randomly distributed, they may frequently fall within dense graph regions, necessitating the processing of a substantial portion of the graph.

To mitigate computational effort, one can incrementally expand the set of affected vertices from the updated graph region, rather than processing all reachable vertices from the initial iteration. Moreover, it is possible to skip processing a vertex's neighbors if the change in its rank is small and expected to have minimal impact on the ranks of neighboring vertices. Here, we introduce the Dynamic Frontier approach for Updating PageRank, which addresses these considerations.

Below we plot the average time taken by Static, Naive-dynamic, Dynamic Traversal, and Dynamic Frontier PageRank on batch updates of size `10^-7|E|` to `0.1|E|`, consisting of `80%` insertions and `20%` deletions (to simulate realistic graph updates), on 12 different graphs. Dynamic Frontier PageRank is on average `7.6√ó`, `2.8√ó`, and `4.1√ó` faster than Static, Naive-dynamic, and Dynamic Traversal PageRank, while obtaining ranks of better accuracy/error than Static PageRank, and of similar accuracy/error as Naive-dynamic and Dynamic Traversal PageRank.

Below we plot the speedup of Dynamic Frontier PageRank wrt Static, Naive-dynamic, and Dynamic Traversal PageRank.

Next, we plot the Error comparison of Static, Naive-dynamic, Dynamic Traversal, and Dynamic Frontier PageRank with respect to a Reference Static PageRank (with a tolerance `ùúè` of `10^‚àí100` and limited to `500` iterations), using L1-norm.

Finally, we plot the strong scaling behaviour of Dynamic Frontier PageRank. With doubling of threads, Dynamic Frontier PageRank exhibits an average performance scaling of `1.8√ó`.
